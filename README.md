Licensing
===

Many of the static assets used in this game, namely the map tiles found in the 'art' directory, inherit their licenses from _[Valyria Tear](https://github.com/Bertram25/ValyriaTear)_, an open-source game. The full licensing details for these assets can be found [here](https://github.com/Bertram25/ValyriaTear/blob/master/LICENSES).

In addition, the character sprites were drawn from _[The Battle for Wesnoth](http://www.wesnoth.org/)_, another open-source game; the licenses for these assets can be found [here](http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Wesnoth:Copyrights).

The battle-scene background was found [online](http://www.download-hd-wallpapers.com/games/2d-game-backgrounds/) and is [believed to be freely reusable](http://www.download-hd-wallpapers.com/disclaimer/) for non-commercial purposes. If you feel that we've misrepresented the licensing for something over which you hold ownership, don't hesitate to reach out.

Any other code found in the repository has been released under the MIT license.
